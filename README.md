# Project-Glitch-Para-dice-Workshop
Greetings and salutations from Project Glitch! What you have downloaded is the code for our Digital Dice project. Seeing how this is an introductory workshop to the realm of coding projects, we have decided to guide you through the basic processes involved in coding projects. Thus, we only require you to write the pseudo-code for this project just to get a feel for what it's like deciding and creating code from scratch. The entire code for the project is included here, where you can download and import it straight into your Arduino IDE afterwards.
If you are interested in the code (such as the syntax of various functions etc.) though, annotations are included for you to be able to follow what the code is doing.
We hope that you enjoy our workshop, and have taken some valuable lessons away from it!
